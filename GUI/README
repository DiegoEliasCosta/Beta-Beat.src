Requirements to run the GUI:
- Windows Manager (Yes, it is really a GUI, not a console application)
- Java >= 1.6 installed and javaws in the environment

To start the GUI, execute one of the shortcuts in the directory.

Files:
-command
Shortcut to run the current stable and tested version. This is most likely a version tested and found to be stable to use in the CCC

-command_dev_release
Shortcut to run the last development release. This version has the newest feature set.
It is stable in a way that it runs without crashing. But is has not been extensively tested and could have obvious or not so obvious bugs.

Folders:
-/sdds_ascii_format/
Contains information about the internally used SDDS ASCII Format for BPM data

If access to an old version is necessary, they can be found here:
http://abwww.cern.ch/ap/dist/lhc/lhc-app-beta-beating/
(But they will most likely have problems because of changes in the BetaBeat directory)
