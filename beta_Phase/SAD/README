I explain how to install SAD in the following.
I recommend to see README document of BetaAnalysis.sad.
It contains the following informations.
 - Structure of directory tree and contents for SAD runtime environment
 - SAD configuration sample for lxplus
 - Structure of directory tree and contents for BetaAnalysis.sad
 - Input/output data format and option summary for BetaAnalysis.sad

How to make SAD runtime environment for BetaAnalysis.sad
1. Getting the source code
 In order to access the SAD source code via CVS pserver or HTTP download,
 you have to get an access account from SAD coordinator.
 The current SAD coordinator is Kamada-San @ KEK(susumu.kamada@kek.jp).

 See following web pages
 SAD Home Page:		http://acc-physics.kek.jp/SAD/
 Release Information:	http://acc-physics.kek.jp/SAD/SADrelease/

 NOTE: Web site is down until 2008/03/11, because web server is
       now moving to new location.

2. Installing SAD runtime environment
 i. Extract the source tree
    Extract downloaded source archive or Export/Checkout oldsad module
    from CVS pserver.

 ii. Edit configure file
    Copy sad.conf.sample to sad.conf and Edit it.

   * In order to install, you MUST configure the top directory of SAD
     runtime environment into SAD_ROOT variable.

   * In order to run on 64bit OS, you MUST configure to generate
     32bit executable and to run 32bit compatible mode, because
     SAD internal pointer limited within signed 35bit integer.

    For example, SAD on lxplus is compiled with following configuration
    # Location for installed runtime environment
    SAD_ROOT=${HOME}/public/SAD
    # Generate 32bit objects
    CC=     gcc -m32
    FC=     g77 -m32
    CXX=    g++ -m32
    # Optimize option
    FOPT=   -O3 -fno-strict-aliasing
    COPT=   -O3 -fno-strict-aliasing 
    CXXOPT= -O3 -fno-strict-aliasing 
    # Enable internal memory debug information
    COPT+=  -DDEBUG_MEMORY
    # Enable mmap address hinting
    COPT+=  -DUSE_ADDR_HINT_IN_MMAP

 iii. Build executable
    Invoke GNU make at the top of source tree.
   
 iv. Install runtime environment
    Invoke GNU make with ``install'' target at the top of source tree.
    SAD runtime environment WOULD be installed under the SAD_ROOT directory.


 (make mostlyclean) to clean!


3. Installing BetaAnalysis.sad
 i. Install BetaAnalysis.sad
    Copy BetaAnalysis.sad into the target system and edit 1st line of it.
    You MUST rewrite 1st line of BetaAnalysis.sad as follows
    #!/usr/bin/env SAD_ROOT/bin/gs
    where SAD_ROOT is the configured top directory of SAD.

 ii. Install SADScript library for BetaAnalysis.sad
    Copy following files into the target system.
    Destination				Source
    LIBDIR/File/TFS.n			KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib/File/TFS.n
    LIBDIR/Optics/BetaAnalysis.n	KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib/Optics/BetaAnalysis.n
    LIBDIR/Math/Minimize.n		KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib/Math/Minimize.n
    LIBDIR/Prog/QFunctions.n		KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib/Prog/QFunctions.n
    where KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib is /afs/cern.ch/user/a/amorita/public/
    mirror-ldata/KEKB/KCG/SAD/lib and LIBDIR is the top directory
    for SADScript library on the target system.

 iii. Customize SAD runtime environment
    Edit SAD_ROOT/share/Packages/init.local.n and append SAD_LIBRARY
    entry into Environment@@[{}] blocks as follows.
    Environment@@[{
      {"UNIX95",""},
      {"TCL_LIBRARY",""},
      {"TK_LIBRARY",""},
      {"KBFRAMEDIR","SAD_ROOT/share/KBFrame"},
      {"PYTHONPATH","SAD_ROOT/share/Packages/"},
   +  {"SAD_LIBRARY","LIBDIR"},
      Null[]},{1}];
    where LIBDIR is the configured top directory for SADScript library.

Sincerely yours,
Akio Morita
