Module Correction.Iterative.iterative_correction
------------------------------------------------

iterative_correction is not used for several years. It is currently not required and thus no refactoring and improving
was applied to this script.

It is not working with the current GUI version. It crashes on a lot of places.
If this script will be needed again one have to put effort to get it running again.
