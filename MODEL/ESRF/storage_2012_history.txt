! Oct. 1st 2010:-Matlab commands for SVD are in matlab_svd.m            !
!               -added coupling response matrix calculation (the same of!
!                sextupole RDTs) in MODULES/compute_coupling.f          !
! Oct. 28th 2010: added separate calibration coefficients for corrector !
!		  sextupoles, one for those in S24 and another for those!
!		  on S20 in storage_2012.strx. They depend on the main  !
!		  sextupole currents and shall be re-defined according  !
!		  to the specific sextupole setting, see MDT 26/10/10.  !
! Oct. 28th 2010: including other zf 1-BPM sext. RDT from FFT(x,y) in   !
!                 MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f zf3,zf2,zf1,zf0 in         !
!		  sext_rdt_fft3.dat and sext_rdt_lat.dat                !
! Nov.4-5th 2010: extended sextupole RM for all zf3-2-1-0 (it was for   !
!		  fz3 only) in MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f. Bug found in !
!                 generator of sext. errors (it didn't mirrored the     !
!		  sextupole names 4-6-13-19-20-22-24-24-22-20 ....      !
! Dec. 14th 2010: added skew sextupole errors J2L_S??_C!! . The routine !
!                 MODULES/generate_sext_err.f modified accordingly: The !
!		  routine generates random sextupole tilts and the skew !
!		  sextupole gradinet J2 is evaluated from the K2 of its !
!		  main corresponding sextupole.                         ! 
! Jan. 17th 2011: RDT analysis of skew sextupoles added in 
!		  MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f . NOTE that for a correct  !
!		  analysis, coupling RDTs need to be evaluated, hence   !
!		  the call of 'storage_2012_coupling.cmdx' needs to be  !
!		  uncommented and launched. For hand-written formulas,  !
!		  see email to Rogelio "Re: unexpected RDT effect" of   !
!		  Jan, 13th. In MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f other norm.  !
!		  sext. RDT (from xy^2 from FFT of correct x-ipx) are   !
!                 computed. 'storage_2012_sext_rdt.cmdx' modified in    !
!                 order to print out skew sextupole strengths (J2) and  !
!                 Twiss parameters for RDT from lattice.                !
! May  16th 2011: including fx,fy 1-BPM coupling RDT from FFT(x,y) in   !
!                 MODULES/compute_coupling_rdt.f zfx,zfy in             !

!                 coup_fft3.dat (Courant-Snyder).                       !
! May  16th 2011: Routine MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f modified to read   !
!                 properly new coup_rdt_lat.dat and to comput 1-BPM RDTs!
!                 zg3-2-1-0 from skew sextupoles: values from lattice   !
!                 are written in the last 8 columns of ssex_rdt_lat.dat,!      
!                 whereas values from FFT of 1-BPM tracking data are    !
!                 saved in  ssex_rdt_fft3.dat.                          !
! May  24th 2011  All tests with skew-sextupole RDTs 1st and 2nd order  !
!                 plus zf-RDTs (from 1 BPM) are completed succesfully:  !
!                 formulas do work! See TEST_SKEWSEXT_* directory       !
! June 24th 2011  Problem encountered in the analysis of TBT data for   !
!                 normal sextupoles zf-RDTs: it is suspected that second-
!                 order contribution from beta-beat+norm. sextupole need!
!                 to be included in order to infer realistic sextupole  !
!                 error. The same second-order analysis carried out for !
!                 skew sextupole needs to be extended to norm. sextupole!
!                 First problem: since the new definition AT-compatible !
!                 of errors in main quadrupoles, the latter are no longer
!                 assigned as thin integrated kicks, but added to the   !
!                 nominal non-integrated gradients: this makes the      !
!                 computation of f2000 and f0020 from lattice wrong,    !
!                 because it searches for integrated normal quadrupole  !
!                 gradients. Modifications in MODULES/compute_beating.f ! 
!                 and storage_2012_betabeat.cmdx are necessary.         !
!                 OK, both files modified, tests are ok, See results in !
!		  BETA_BEAT_TESTS/ . Note that second-order beta-beat   !
!		  seem important and FFT-RDTs reproduce very well beta- !
!		  beating. But first-order lattice RDTs will be used by !
!		  MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f because those are needed in!
!		  the formulas.
! July  7th 2011  2 bugs fixed in MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f . In the   !
!		  FFT of 1-BPM tracking Courant-Snyder data there was an!
!		  ambiguity over the tune line <0.5 or >0.5: solved with!
!		  and IF before detecting lines. In the routine SPECTRUM!
!		  the search of the peak closest to the guessed tune has!
!		  been removed (an heritage from coupling studies with  !
!		  tunes very closed), as with strong detuning the tune  !
!		  and secondary lines may be missed or misassigned      !
! Sept  2nd 2011  Modify MODULES/compute_beating.f to compute a response!

!                 MODULES/compute_beating.f.bkp created as backup.      !
!                 Two new files are created: "beat_rdtvector.dat" with  !

!                 32 (52) correctors. The SVD inversion is done by the  !
!		  matlab routine "get_quad_correctors.m" that generates !
!                 "storage_NormQuadCorr.strx" to be called by           !
!                 storage_2012_betabeat.cmdx  to test its validity      !
! Sept 16th 2011  Modify MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f in order to compute !
!		  the response matrix between skew-sextupole CRDTs and  !
!		  skew sextupole strengths in the 224 main sextupoles,  !
!		  to be then converted in angles. The backup copy is    !

!		  is needed. K2 is also modified with K2*cos(3*Tilt).   !
! Sept 17th 2011  Modify MODULES/compute_sext_rdt.f to output a TBT file!
!		  compatible with "fft_compute_hv5.f": units in [mm] and!
!		  first 17 turns are zeros.                             !

! April 18th 2012: bug found and fixed in the definition of bendings:the!
!                 two pole faces E1 and E2 were wrong. The sequence     !

! April 18th 2012: bug found and fixed in the position of the BPM4 in   !
!                 the odd cells: they are not symmetric w.r.t. the      !
!                 straight section centre. The two sequence files       !
!                 "storage_2012.seqx" & "storage_2012_7mSS23.seqx" have !
!                 been modified accordngly (shift of -0.76599976 m).    !
