In job.Beam2.ACdipoletracking.6500GEV.40cm.madx  
   call.LHCglobalknob.matchCoupling.b2.madx
   ExeDiffAmplitudes_jobs.sh
replace PATH_TO_FOLDER by the full path to the folder in which the simulations are done (this folder)

Change tunes in DriveFiles/Drive.inp if changed in job.Beam2.ACdipoletracking.6500GEV.40cm.madx + replace corresponding models twiss_elements.dat and twiss_elements_ac.dat

Execute ./ExeDiffAmplitudes_jobs.sh
When jobs are all finished (important!): execute ./ExeDiffAmplitudes_analyse.sh

Results can be found in DataAnalysis.

________________________________________________________________________
ATTENTION: if simulated amplitudes changed in ExeDiffAmplitudes_jobs.sh:
	   change as well in 
	   - ExeDiffAmplitudes_analyse.sh
	   - DataAnalysis/python_getacTuneAndAction.py in array amplitude=[...] (same digits then in ExeDiffAmplitudes_jobs.sh!)

Trackone files are kept, for the case, the analysis fails; they can be removed by hand afterwards to save memory

In some cases, the natural tune might be misidentified by GetLLM, leading to jumps in the amplitude detuning plots; in this case, look at BPM spectrum for concerned amplitude(s)
